#### This is a small part of the research into similarity within abstract groups, and it's properties.

All the txt files contain data from GAP system, that it is processed in Python using networkx library.

File *groupalg.g* has the code for S_M similarity measure and the construction of the corresponding similarity matrix.

File *groupalg_num.g* has a numerical test to check that the complexity of the algorithm to build the similarity matrix of a group, is in fact quadratic on the order of the group.
